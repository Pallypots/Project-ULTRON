# Changelog

## 0.2.0 · 2026-10-30 · Dev cycle 2: UL-008 voice input
- Push-to-talk in Chat: hold the Talk button or Space, click-to-latch hands-free, Esc to cancel; live listening bar, timer and level meter; HUD core reacts to voice level.
- Speech recognition engines: local Whisper on the PC (default, free, private), OpenAI transcription, test engine. One-time model download with progress.
- Settings → Voice: engine/model, microphone picker that follows device changes, mic test meter, send-immediately vs review-first.
- Voice messages are stored as text marked `inputMode: voice` (migration 2). Audio is never stored; the audit log records mic use without content.
- Plain-English errors for blocked/missing/busy microphones, silent or too-short recordings.
- New `@ultron/audio` package; voice API tests; real-Whisper test and browser E2E (fake microphone) in Windows + Linux CI.
